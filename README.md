This program is used to create an interface for users to view a 3D model of the biofilm according to what they want to see. Open the program using a web browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox.

After opening the web page, simply select the type of bacteria along with the optical density you wish to see, and click the submit button. If a bacteria type is not selected, an error message will show up. After clicking the submit button, a link will show up on the screen. This link will direct the user to another file showing the 3D visualization of the required biofilm.
