This program is used to create an interface for users to view a 3D model of the biofilm according to what they want to see. To run the program, go to the terminal and type the command: python "Visualization of 3D Model of Biofilm.py", and a new window should appear.

After the new window shows up, simply select the type of bacteria along with the optical density you wish to see, and click the submit button. After clicking the submit button, a link will show up on the screen. This link will direct the user to another file showing the 3D visualization of the required biofilm.
